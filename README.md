## Libraries/utilites:

**General:**

- `react-router-dom` Used for handling routing. I think this is a best choice for react routing nowadays.

**Task 1. Interactive desktop:**

- `react-grid-layout:` Used for creating an interactive desktop layout. It helps manage grid-based positioning, movement, and resizing of blocks effectively, easily and customizable.

**Task 2. Websocket connection:**

- `Default WebSocket:` Utilized to subscribe to transactions through the Blockchain WebSocket API. For this task, pure WebSocket is the optimal solution. While socket.io may be more suitable for more complex requirements or when working with custom servers, the default WebSocket offers a simpler, more appropriate approach here.
